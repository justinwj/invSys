Diagram view modes

---

# ⭐ **THE MAXIMUM VIEW–MODE SET**

This is the **gold standard** of diagram categories used in large, mature engineering ecosystems (Microsoft, Google, Meta, SAP, Amazon, NASA).

It defines *every* diagram type that VDG could ultimately generate — whether the underlying system is VBA, C#, Python, or a microservice platform.

It’s the *complete universe* of developer-relevant diagrams.

---

# 🜁 **1. System-Level Views** (5 views)

These explain *the whole system* at high altitude.

1. **Ecosystem Map**

   * Systems, subsystems, external dependencies.

2. **Service Boundary / Module Boundary View**

   * Major modules/components + directed dependencies.

3. **Deployment & Hosting View**

   * Where things run. Machines, containers, Excel, clients.

4. **Integration Interfaces View**

   * APIs, data imports/exports, scheduled tasks.

5. **Runtime Behavior Overview**

   * High-level diagram of how the system behaves at runtime (e.g., request paths or event flows).

---

# 🜂 **2. Architectural Views** (8 views)

These explain *the architecture of the codebase* itself.

6. **Layered Architecture View**

   * UI → Logic → Data → Integration.

7. **Module Internal Structure View**

   * What's inside a module (submodules, classes, forms).

8. **Component Communication View**

   * Major flows between high-level components.

9. **Data Architecture View**

   * All major datasets, tables, files, logs, bindings.

10. **Error & Logging Architecture View**

* How errors propagate and where logs are stored.

11. **Security / Permissions View**

* Roles, access flows, protected areas.

12. **Configuration View**

* App settings, environment variables, workbook/names-defined config.

13. **State-Transition View**

* How the system changes state during key operations.

# 🜄 **3. Workflow / Process Views** (∞ views, but usually 10–50)

These show **real workflows**, each diagram answering **one “business” use-case**.

14. **Add Goods Received Workflow**
15. **Deduct Shipments Workflow**
16. **Login Workflow**
17. **Undo/Redo Workflow**
18. **Bulk Import Workflow**
19. **Reset PIN Workflow**
20. **Create/Delete User Workflow**
21. **Admin Controls Workflow**
22. **Orders Tally workflow**
    …etc.

There is typically **one workflow diagram per feature**.

**Total here is unbounded but practical systems have 10–50.**

---

# 🜃 **4. UI / Surface Views** (4 views)

These describe the *entry-points* of the system.

23. **Forms Map** (UserForms + Worksheets)
24. **Controls Interaction View** (buttons, combos, etc.)
25. **Event Entry Point View** (button clicks → event handlers → modules)
26. **User Navigation View** (what screens lead to what)

---

# 🜁 **5. Dataflow Views** (5 views)

27. **CRUD Flow View** (Create/Read/Update/Delete flows)
28. **Cross-Module Dataflow**
29. **Report/Export Flow**
30. **Logging & Snapshot Dataflow**
31. **Transaction Dataflow**

---

# 🜂 **6. Code-Level / Developer-Facing Views** (10 views)

32. **Call Graph View (filtered)**

* Per module only, never full system.

33. **Event Graph**

* Events → handlers.

34. **Module Dependency View**

* Submodules / functions calling each other.

35. **Error Propagation View**

* Try/catch boundaries, error routes.

36. **Function Responsibility Map**

* What each function *does* or *touches*.

37. **Hotspot View**

* What code changes most frequently.

38. **Anchor Classes / Core Routines View**

* Central routines and who they depend on.

39. **Threading / Asynchrony View** (if relevant)

* For VBA/Excel this is usually trivial or unused.

40. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**

* High granularity: branches, loops, exits.

41. **Data Structure View**

* Types + fields + relationships.

---

# 🜄 **7. Specialized Views** (8 views)

42. **Performance Bottleneck View**
43. **Test Coverage View**
44. **Onboarding View (Simplified)**
45. **Refactor Opportunity View**
46. **“What To Change If…” Views** (change impact analysis)
47. **Deprecation/Legacy View**
48. **Release/Version Diff View**
49. **Migration Roadmap View**

# ⭐ **TOTAL MAXIMUM VIEW-MODES (REALISTIC)**

If you tally:

* System-level: 5
* Architectural: 8
* Workflow: ~20
* UI: 4
* Dataflow: 5
* Code-level: 10
* Specialized: 8

**Grand total = ~60+ possible meaningful views.**

In real enterprise systems:
→ **40–120 view-modes is common.**
In highly structured orgs (NASA, medical compliance):
→ **200+ view-modes** is not unusual.

This is **not** gimmicky.
This is how real architecture tooling scales.

# 🚀 **Your system’s realistic “maximum”**

Given:

* inv_Sys
* 30+ modules
* 200+ functions
* 20+ workflows
* multi-layer logic
* admin system
* tally subsystem
* recipes system
* logging
* undo/redo
* snapshots
  …etc.

A true maximum is:

### **≈ 40–60 distinct diagrams.**

This is the range where:

* each diagram answers *one* question
* no diagram is overloaded
* everything is legible
* developer experience is excellent
* onboarding takes days, not months

# 🧭 Want the recommended **VDG View-Mode Taxonomy** for your project?

I can build:

* the full list of recommended view types
* which ones matter most first
* how to filter the system model for each
* what metadata each view should show
* what style rules each view enforces
* page layout rules for each

Just tell me:

**“Give me the VDG recommended view-mode taxonomy.”**

and I’ll generate the full blueprint.
